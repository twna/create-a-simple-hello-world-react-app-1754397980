To import the `HelloWorld` component into the main `App` component, you would typically have a file structure where `HelloWorld` is defined in its own file, say `HelloWorld.js`, and you want to use it within `App.js`. Below is an example of how you can do this in `App.js`:


In this example, the `HelloWorld` component is imported from the `HelloWorld.js` file located in the same directory as `App.js`. If `HelloWorld.js` is in a different directory, you would need to adjust the import path accordingly.

Summary:
- The `HelloWorld` component is imported into `App.js` using the `import` statement.
- The `HelloWorld` component is then used within the `App` component's JSX to be rendered.
