Certainly! However, since I don't have the existing `App.css` file or the specific styles you want for the `HelloWorld` component, I'll provide a general example. You can then modify or expand upon these styles to suit your needs.

Here's a simple CSS update for a hypothetical `HelloWorld` component:


Summary:
- The `.HelloWorld` class applies a font, padding, border, margin, border-radius, background color, and text alignment to the component.
- The `.HelloWorld h1` class specifies the font size and margin for `h1` elements within the component.
- The `.HelloWorld p` class sets the font size and color for `p` elements within the component.

Please adjust the styles according to your specific requirements or the existing design of your application.
