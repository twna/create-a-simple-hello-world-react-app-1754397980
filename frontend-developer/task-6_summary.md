To ensure the application runs correctly by starting the development server, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your application.
3. Run the command to start the development server. This command can vary depending on the technology stack you are using. For example:
   - If you're using Node.js with Express, you might run `npm start` or `node server.js`.
   - For a React application created with Create React App, you would run `npm start`.
   - For a Python Flask application, you might run `flask run`.
   - For a Ruby on Rails application, you would run `rails server`.

Here is an example of how you might start a development server for a Node.js application:


Please replace `path/to/your/application` with the actual path to your application and adjust the commands according to your specific application's requirements.

Summary:
To start the development server, you need to navigate to the application's root directory in the terminal and run the appropriate command to start the server. This command will depend on the technology stack used by the application.
